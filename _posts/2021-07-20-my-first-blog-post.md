This is my first blog post. I'm learning to use GitHub Pages while I create it. This will be my personal blog, where I'll write posts about my life, my journey in learning to code, and the projects I've created.
I run another blog on life living with multiple disabilities, but it's for a community and hopefully a future organization.
In case you haven't looked at my profile on GitHub, let me introduce myself.
My name is Lanie Molinar. I'm a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I'm also blind, autistic, and have multiple chronic illnesses.
I'm a student taking courses on software development with [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). My goal is to become a software developer and accessibility tester, helping developers to make their products more accessible for people with disabilities.
Finally, I'm working with others to found a community and nonprofit organization run by and for people living with multiple disabilities. You can check out our blog and community at [livingwithmultipledisabilities.org](http://livingwithmultipledisabilities.org).
